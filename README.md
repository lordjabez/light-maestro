Light Maestro
=============

Light Maestro is a system that provides a HTTP JSON API (and accompanying web application) for DMX-based lighting control. This API and GUI can be used by a variety of personal electronic devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, laptops) to do basic control of the lighting system without requiring complicated, expensive, and proprietary hardware or software. It is designed to be plug and play with no configuration required.
